# Portfolio Site

[![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-COMPLETE-GREEN.svg)](https://shields.io/)  - [Amanda Taylor: Portfolio](https://amandataylor-portfolio.netlify.app "My finished site")

My goal is to create a portfolio website that highlights not only the all of the coding projects that I've worked on, but the marketing that I've worked on and the numerous portraits that I've created. I really want to highlight that I'm a software developer that also has an eye for design.
